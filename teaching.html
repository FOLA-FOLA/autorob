                <h4>BC 3600 - Construction Cost Management</h4>
                <p>The course introduces students to cost principles and cost analysis of construction projects, including
                    classification of work, quantity survey techniques, construction operation costs, and bid proposals. At the
                    end of the course, students will be able to prepare approximate cost estimates; explain the construction
                    bidding process from the bidder’s or estimator’s perspective and be able to identify the various documents
                    of the construction bid package; explain different project delivery methods; apply cost management
                    techniques to construction projects; and use Bluebeam software for effective communication, document
                    management, and quantity takeoffs.

                <h4>CEM 3154 - Smart Construction</h4>
                <p>This course exposes students to the inefficiencies associated with the traditional approaches to construction
                    and the intelligence requirements of the building lifecycle. This course aims to develop undergraduate
                    students’ understanding of smart planning, design, and contracting practices, enabling technologies, and
                    strategies for involving downstream stakeholders in the design of buildings for constructability and
                    maintainability. The course also provides students with hands-on experience with the implementation of
                    digital infrastructure in enhancing the productivity and safety of construction projects.
                    <br><strong>Duties:</strong></p> Conducting lab sessions and grading students’ labs, homework, and exams;
                    Supervising students’ use of various sensing technologies for smart construction class;
                    Teaching students data processing with machine learning algorithms; Preparing manuals
                    and lecture notes for teaching sensing technologies like laser scanners, Global Positioning
                    System, and Electroencephalogram; Grading of students’ assignment and exams.</p>
